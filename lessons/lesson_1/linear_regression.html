            <h1>Linear Regression</h1>
            <div>
                Linear regression is a statistical technique used to find the relationship between variables. In an ML context, linear regression finds the relationship between features and a label.
    
    For example, suppose we want to predict a car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon based on how heavy the car is, and we have the following dataset:
            </div>
            <div>
                <table id="table-weight-mpg">
                    <thead>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody >
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
